## CCO-D-Acts
CCO-D-Acts fills a gap in representation of social, legal, normative, and deontic entities for ontologies that rely on the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) suite. Within the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) ecosystem the Document Acts (D-Acts) ontology is an extension of the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) that represents the generic domain of entities relevant to the creation, modification, or termination of social arrangements by means of some document. Examples of such documents include marriage licenses, mortgage contracts, parking tickets, etc. The Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) imports D-Acts, for example.

The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) are a suite of mid-level ontologies conformant with BFO, that provide representation of generic domains such as agents, artifacts, events, information, etc. The Information Entity Ontology (IEO) is one of those mid-level ontologies of the CCO suite, with a high overlap in domain as IAO. However, IAO and IEO have conflicting models.

Since D-Acts is an extension of IAO, it would benefit those who rely on CCO ontologies to have a D-Acts counterpart conformant with IEO. This project proposes that counterpart: **CCO-D-Acts**.
